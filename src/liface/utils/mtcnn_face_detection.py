    bounding boxes, processes them through O-Net to refine box locations and
    predict facial landmarks, and postprocesses the outputs with NMS and box
    calibration.

            - torch.Tensor: Landmark coordinates of shape (K, 5, 2), where each
              row contains (x, y) coordinates of the 5 predicted facial landmarks.
